I was curious, but 
I never had time to stop. A few days ago, I decided to make a trip to see what this curious place contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine Museum describes itself as a “Comprehensive Survey of Contemporary Glass Art”.  More information about the 
museum and the studio glass movement is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imaginemuseum.com/about-imagine/&quot;&gt;available on their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their collection was, in a word, stunning.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys optical experimentation, or art
in general.  Photos of a few of my favorite pieces are included below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you visit, consider stopping by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haslams.com/&quot;&gt;Haslam’s Book Store&lt;/a&gt; and grab a bite to eat at the 
vegan cafe next door, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovefoodcentral.com/&quot;&gt;Love Food Central&lt;/a&gt;.  Both are about a block away from the museum.&lt;/p&gt;

I discovered it around the time I started running, and it has a little gem buried in the chorus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;♫ I’m counting all the numbers between zero and one ♫&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds simple, right?  0… 1.  That’s it.  &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this assumes that “numbers” only refers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/cc-6th-factors-and-multiples/whole-numbers-integers/a/whole-numbers-integers&quot;&gt;whole numbers&lt;/a&gt;.  What if we include fractions, decimals, and weird numbers like π?  How many of those exist between zero and one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out the answer is a lot.  Think: infinity, but more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were taught by a good math teacher, you were taught that infinity is not a number; it is a concept representing something boundless – something larger than anything real that can be represented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were taught by a great math teacher, you were taught that there is more than one level of infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first level of infinity represents that which can be counted – or rather, could be counted if you never stopped.  For example, consider whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, …  If you go on counting forever, you will eventually reach all of them.  This also applies to integers, and even fractions if you are clever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not everything can be reduced to a countable list like this.  Consider the spaces between the whole numbers – how many &lt;a href=&quot;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number&quot;&gt;real numbers&lt;/a&gt; (including all whole numbers, fractions, irrational numbers, etc.) exist between each pair of them?  Infinite.  Uncountably infinite, in fact.  So many that you can’t even count them with whole numbers.  The video below goes into the gritty details of why this is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this brings us to the gem: &lt;strong&gt;it’s not possible to count the numbers between zero and one&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you went on counting forever, you wouldn’t even get close.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;An argument could be made that even this is too much if &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrictlyBetween.html&quot;&gt;“between”&lt;/a&gt; is not inclusive, but I digress. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

time to realize it.  After nearly three decades under the stars, I am
still learning to appreciate their magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-exists&quot;&gt;Space exists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, I discovered how cathartic a stroll could be.  The
increased blood-flow, the fresh air, and the change of scenery were
often my best tools to cope with adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly troubled night, I stepped into my yard and was
struck by the beauty of clouds crossing in front of the moon.
The cool breeze stirred a sense of wonder in me, and I stood looking
up at the sky.  The longer I stared, the more stars I saw.  I had never
realized that most stars were invisible at first glance.  I felt
like I had stumbled into a secret world.  I stared at the sky for a
half-hour before my parents called me inside. When they asked me why
I had gone outside in the first place, I couldn’t remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t yet comprehend what I had seen, but I knew it was worth seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-is-huge&quot;&gt;Space is huge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, I went on an overnight canoeing/camping trip with my
church.  I was a shy kid, and I hadn’t yet made any friends in the
youth group.  I was also one of the few kids to bring a tent that
slept more than one person.  So when I was asked if someone could sleep
in it, I awkwardly agreed.  Then another person asked, and I agreed
again. By the time I started to do the math, the tent was over capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was most comfortable alone anyway, so I slept on the sand along
the river’s edge.  Away from the city’s light pollution, I saw the full sky
for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even at a glance, there were hundreds of stars.  Thousands.  After my
night vision recovered, my mind wrestled with the concept of innumerability. 
I was awe-struck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the first shooting star flashed across the sky.  Of course, I
made a wish.  And then another.  And another.  Within a few minutes, I
had run out of wishes and just took it all in.  I don’t know how long
I stared at the sky that night, but I know I was the last camper to fall
asleep.  And I was sorely disappointed to wake up to a bright sky the
next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-is-romantic&quot;&gt;Space is romantic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I returned home, I began researching stars.  I downloaded some
software to my computer that let me simulate the observed universe and
I began to learn the most basic constellations.  (Basically, I could
spot Orion’s belt and infer where Orion was.  I was never quite sure
which direction was his head, though.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just begun to spend time with a girl I liked, and I
decided to share my new fascination with her.  We went into my yard one
night, along with a laptop that held a map to the sky, and tried to find
constellations.  We were terrible at it, but it was a lot of fun.  I
hadn’t even planned the night to be romantic – I just wanted to share
something that I liked with one of my favorite people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That girl, Danielle, became the love of my life.  We both remember
that night fondly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-is-within-reach&quot;&gt;Space is within reach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As high school came to a close, I found myself preoccupied with thoughts
of my future.  When I moved away to college, I found myself in a big
city with light pollution.  I rarely saw the stars, and to an extent,
I forgot they were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, while reading a technology news site, I became
fascinated by SpaceX’s plans to land and reuse rocket boosters.  After
realizing that rocket launches can be seen from across the state on a clear day,
I found myself atop a parking garage looking east.  I saw
the smoke of the launch, watched the landing live on my phone,
and I was hooked. A few weeks later, the next rocket launch
happened at 2am, and I was able to clearly see the rocket’s red glare
as it carried supplies to the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started following rocket launches obsessively, logged hundreds of
hours playing Kerbal Space Program, went on a camping trip with friends
specifically because it coincided with a meteor shower, acquired
Kennedy Space Center passes with Danielle, and even celebrated
my birthday at a dark sky event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these experiences sprung from an important discovery: space
is within reach.  We know more about the cosmos, and our place in it,
than we ever have before.  We can do better than scrape the sky – we
can inhabit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-is-ours&quot;&gt;Space is ours&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important for me to note that my wife, Danielle, has been very
patient and supportive of my growing obsession.  She shares my love for
the cosmos and our place in it.  Many of the magical space-related
experiences I have had would not have been possible (or nearly as much
fun) without her support and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important part of her planning has been to include friends.  As
someone comfortable alone, I often forget the joy of sharing experiences
with others.  But the experiences I have had with friends have almost
always been the most fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such experience was the Great American Eclipse of 2017.  Ever since
I found out about the eclipse, I had hoped to see it.  However, due
to health problems and stress at work, I failed to plan for it properly.
After I expressed my disappointment at not being able to see totality,
Danielle and a good friend planned a way for us to stay in South Carolina
with our friend’s family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, once we were in South Carolina, we found ourselves in a city
with poor weather.  I contacted a friend in a nearby city, and they
graciously allowed us to sleep at their house and experience the
eclipse with them the next day.  As magical as the eclipse itself was, an
important part of the magic was the company I shared that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the coverage and the number of people who experienced it
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/37939-great-american-solar-eclipse-nasa-web-record.html&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.denverpost.com/2017/08/22/solar-eclipse-wyoming-most-traffic-record/&quot;&gt;in person&lt;/a&gt;, I hope that
many others are beginning this same journey of wonder and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This universe is ours to discover and explore.  We just have to look up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danielle and I had gone out shopping to pick up some necessities for the week. 
It was raining, so neither of us had much desire to be out, but out we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we finished, the rain had stopped, but the ground was still wet. 
We walked to the car, put all of the groceries in the back, and I put away the grocery cart. 
On my way back to the car, I noticed a furry white thing dash under the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared blankly at the pavement trying to make sense of what I had seen.  It was too 
small to be a cat, and the way it moved reminded me of a rodent.
According to Danielle, all I said during this time was “Aww…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is it?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think a rat just crawled under the car,” I said, deciding that the furry 
must not have been a cat.  She looked, and sure enough it was a little black 
and white Fancy Rat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do we do about it?” she asked, hesitantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Catch it, of course.”  Some part of me knew that what I was doing was crazy, 
but a larger part of me didn’t care.  I love rats, and I had several as pets 
during college.  Regardless of the outcome, if I didn’t try to save 
this animal from the cats and soccer moms that would surely kill it on sight, 
I knew I would regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danielle took a little convincing, but when I explained to her that Fancy 
Rats don’t exist in the wild, she decided to let me try my crackpot plan. 
We took a recycling bin out of the trunk, put some of the cereal we had 
just bought inside of it, and tried to coax the rat into it.  She was much 
to clever for that (the nickname we gave her at first was “Prudence”). 
After about 15 minutes of her avoiding the bin by walking sideways like a 
crab, I put the bin down.  Enough of that nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time, a few Publix employees had noticed our erratic movements 
around the parking lot (I can only imagine what we looked like to people 
that didn’t see the rat).  When one of them walked up to see what was going on, 
the rat simply ran up to him and crawled around on his shoes for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he went back into the store, I decided to test my luck.  Against 
my better judgement (and Danielle’s warnings), I decided to simply kneel 
down and hold out my hand.  The rat walked right up to me.  I tried to pick 
her up, and she let me.  Deciding not to tempt fate, I quickly placed her into 
the recycling bin.  She didn’t seem to mind.  Danielle later wondered if the 
rat just wanted to be held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danielle and I took her home, the insanity of what we were doing sinking 
in along the way.  Now what?  I pulled out the travel cage we had for our other pet rats
(a bird cage that I found in the garbage a few years back) and filled 
it with bedding, a box, food, and water.  We placed the new rat in.  She didn’t 
bite me this time either.  (I must be a rat whisperer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave her a quick examination, and to my amazement, she seemed perfectly 
healthy, except for the sneezing, which I guessed was partially 
caused by being out in the rain.  I took her to the vet the next day, 
and he confirmed my thoughts… she just had a mild case 
of myco.  And he was “fairly sure” that she was a female. When I mentioned 
that most male rats I’ve encountered were quite obviously male, he merely 
commented, “Yeah, usually…”  Deciding I didn’t want to know the story behind 
that comment, I laughed it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gave me some medicine to give her, and we were on our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we already had rats, and this one had become our “new girl”, 
Danielle suggested the name Zoey, a tribute to Zooey Deschanel. I 
thought it was clever, and our other 
room-mate was fine with it, so it was decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoey – the rat who lived. What are the odds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/post-assets/rat-zoey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Zoey the rat&quot; title=&quot;Zoey the rat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is the story of the rat we brought home from Publix.</summary></entry></feed>
